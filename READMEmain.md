#the code started from splash classes , which gives a delay of 
4s after which its check if the user is login or not . if not then its open login classes
#in login class there user can login or switch to register classes 
#In registration classes , user can create their account,
i have initially wrote a code about verifying number but due to its a small 
project I removed that part.
#after registration the user redirect to main activity classes 
where there is a feature of log out and .
#in Main activity, there is recycler view which displays the users and 
i have set a filter which verify if the user is present in contact 
,if not then the user can not see other user.
upon clicking user,its redirect to chatwindo.where there is 
option to write and send text.as of now 
if you are willing to add more features go ahead, I will also try to do it
